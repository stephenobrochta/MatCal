# MatCal

Radiocarbon (14C) age calibration using Bayesian statistics. Produces publication quality calibration plots, 1 sigma (68.27%) and 2 sigma (95.45%) calibrated age probabilities calculated using highest posterior density, as well as a probability density function of calibrated age for use in age modelling. Calibration output can be in either cal BP or BCE/CE (BC/AD), and a reservoir age can be specified if necessary. The user can choose from a number of calibration curves, including the latest version of IntCal.

How to install:
---------------
(1) Create a directory called 'matcal' somewhere on your computer and unzip the contents of the 'MatCal-master' repository to that directory.

(3) Click Add Folder to permanently add the 'matcal' directory to your Matlab search path.

(4) Click OK and then Save to get back to the Matlab interface.

(5) Type 'help matcal' into the command window. If the install has succeeded, you will now see the matcal help documentation.
